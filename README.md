# ee298-deeplearning-assignment1
this is my respository for EE 298 Deep Learning class

For our class assignment,I used:

a tolerance value, delta, of 0.1
a varying learning rate,epsilon, 
an initial value of 0.0001 if it is a 3rd degree polynomial and 
an initial value of 0.001 if the polynomial degree is less than 3
